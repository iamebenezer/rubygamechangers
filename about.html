                <p>The rack & pinion is the most interesting/
                  challenging part.
                  Name of robot is Ruby Mach, it was choosed by
                  Alamezie Victory. Ruby stands for Rubochi , Mach
                  means Machine
                  Fun story about our robot (url) is that initially when we
                  started building the most challenging part of the robot
                  (rack & pinion). We find it difficult to achieve because of
                  its complexity and lack of LEGO bricks. We became
                  frustrated and got confused. Sometimes it works;
                  sometimes it fails so it was full of mixed reactions. Then
                  all students told the teachers (coach) that the robot
                  design/built is not good and should be completely
                  changed. But the teacher told us that we should be patient
                  and work more on the robot and the attachment (rack
                  &pinion), that if it doesn’t work after working on it for
                  the next few days, then he accepts the decision of the
                  whole team to change the design of the robot.
                  After few days of practice, modification, and thinking out
                  of the box we were able to perfect the robot
                  programming/design and the attachment (rack &
                  pinion).
                  What is interesting; is that the very moment we perfected
                  it we were all happy and jumped up and down in
                  expression of our feeling then one of us shouted that
                  remember I told you to believe in the coach (teacher)
                  when he told us not to discard the design and make it
                  work he then make a gesture with his hand touching his
                  head (meaning that the teacher is very brave). We all
                  busted into laugh as he was making that gesture and
                  emphasizing that, even the teacher saw him and was
                  laughing. Ever since then we always believe in ourselves
                  and listen to the instruction of the coach. </p>

                <p>(a).The team strategy is to have a robot that perform mission with high accuracy and allow attachment that are permanent on the robot or performs more than one task</p>
                  <p>(b) We Wrote programs that enable the robot to perform more than one tasks before coming back to the home to avoid multiple number of touching the robot and replacing attachment which will consume time because of man made errors.</p>
                  <p>(c) Another interesting strategy is that we did not use too many attachments.</p>
                  <p>(d) We always start our missions with the task that has highest scores among the task that we want to do the round (2.5min), also we start a mission with the closest task.</p>
                  Success of mission completion: our robot is very successful in completing the chosen mission. Success rate is 90% per mission.</p>
                  Favourite missions: Favourite mission includes: basketball, slide and bench. Reasons: The basketball is a difficult mission to complete. Not very many competing teams can completely performs the missions. (In fact no school (team) completed the mission in the north zone during the zonal competition) except our robot. And it’s accuracy of performing the mission is 100%. It has program and mechanism that always correct errors if there is any when performing the mission. The robot can place a cube in the basket also raise the basket up to the highest point.
                  The robot always removes the human from the slide and bring them home; success rate is 100%.
                  BENCH: This mission is of the mission that has the highest possible point. Ruby machine has a success rate of 85%.</p>

                <p>When we started designing the robot, we were following existing designs that we could find (outline and in the spike building guidelines ). But due to lack of expansion kits, we were limited in achieving those designs. We had to stop following existing designs and focus on making the robot design in our own way to suit the mission we want to perform. We continue modifying the robot as we practice and fix errors that arises.</p>

                <p>Our robot design is a very high robot.
                  So we make sure there are parts at the base of the robot
                  that gives support, this ensure that despite the height of
                  the robot it remains stable and never fall off. It is very
                  easy to remove or add attachment to the robot because all
                  attachment where on the rack & pinion. Which provide
                  extension for the attachments for easy addition / removal.
                <strong>Movement (drive train):</strong> the robot uses the big tire to
                  move which make it cover more ground in less time
                  compared to small tire.
                  Attachments: our robot (ruby machine) has three
                  attachment and five gears systems (mechanism) to operate
                  or complete mission.
                  <p> The rack & pinion has a removable / detachable level
                  that carries cube and in the basket and also uses the carrier
                  (lever) to raise the basket/cube to the peak of the
                  basketball stand. The lever has a mechanism that drops
                  cube and ensure that the cube is accurately placed inside
                  the basket without falling off. Another mechanism with
                  the carrier is what we call the connecting/correcting rode;
                  this ensures that as the robot approaches the basket; if the
                  connecting Lever is about to miss the target (basket), the
                  connecting rode/correcting rode correct the error and
                  forces it to be placed accurately with the basket.
                  These mechanisms ensure that the robot produces 99.9%
                  result whenever the mission is attempted.
                  Drive train; talking about how our robot moves; our
                  robot move in a manner that prevent errors or move in a
                  certain direction to correct or ensure a mission is
                  completed accurately. Examples of our error correction
                  movement (drive train) can be seen during our bench
                  mission. The robot will move twice if the cubes are not
                  yet in the bench or if the bench is not fell down. We call
                  this movement(drive train) error correction..</p>

                <p>
                  The robot is programmed using the prime
                  spike software. To ensure consistent results movement
                  from one point to the other, the program has an 
                  algorithm which is written to correct errors or avoid
                  errors while the robot is moving along the mission field.
                  For instance; if the robot is moving from point A to point
                  B it’s programmed to move straight no matter what
                  happens; this was possible by configuring the inbuilt gyro
                  sensor and using the right algorithm. The turning of the
                  robot at any point on the mission field; there is an
                  algorithm we have written that correct accumulated errors
                  during movement to ensure it will turn to the desired
                  angle at all time.
                  Our robot has an algorithm that makes sure the robot
                  returns back to home if for instance it attempted a
                  mission and failed while performing the mission.
                  SENSOR; the robot (ruby machine) uses sensor such as
                  ultrasonic to identify its position on the mission field.
                  The sensor as a component,t in our robot is so important
                  and effective i.e. it allows the algorithm (program ) to

                <p>the features in our robot that are special and
                  cleverly different are ;
                  the rack and pinion
                  the lever carrier
                  cube-dropper rack
                  I. the rack and pinion attachment; this attachment is unique and
                  different from others you can find anywhere nationally and
                  internationally. <p>Because (1) it controls about 4 gears and can
                  accommodate other attachment such as the cube dropper for the
                  boucci mission and the lever carrier for lifting the basket ball.</p> <p> (2)
                  It’s highly fortified, complex and strong. It has never break down
                  or had any issue since it was built over six months ago with despite
                  running it’s gear at maximum speed and power at every practice, it
                  requires no adjustment whatsoever.</p>
                  ii. The lever carrier: this is the attachment attached to the pinion to
                  drop and carry the basket ball to the peak of the basket ball stand.
                  This very attachment has a feature at its front that ensure that the
                  cube doesn’t fall off at any point while moving no matter the speed
                  of the robot and also ensure that the cube never misses the basket
                  or drop off away from the basket while dropping the cube.
                  Also, there is what we call the connecting rode or correcting rode;
                  this rode ensure that the robot places the carrier rack
                  approximately in the basket by correcting errors or prevent errors
                  that has accumulated during the angular turning and high speed
                  movement close to the basket mission.
                  These unique features are what you can’t find in any other robot
                  that uses this type of attachment.
                  lii. CUBE-DROPPER RACK; this attachment is used for the
                  bench mission. It has a feature that we also call correcting rode;
                  this rode is shaped in a 600
                  angle . It ensures that the rack is
                  properly placed in the right position to the bench by correcting
                  errors that have accumulated while the robot was moving it
                  towards the bench</p>
